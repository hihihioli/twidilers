# Welcome to Twidilers
You should be one of the three of us. Otherwise, why are you here?
Github told me to add this but I don't know what to write here.
Why does this page exist?

## What have we done?
### 12/2/24
I added some dependencies to the navbar--we need to add login.html, newuser.html, about.html, and a header logo. Of course, we don't have to do this but I tried to get the ball rolling.

Made the html files and logo stuff. Tomorrow going to make the models and schema for the database when Oliver creates it on the server.

### 12/3/24
Added animations and dark mode. Added more page content

## What should we work on?
* a proper dark mode--not just inverted colors or an inverse filter (done)
* a log-in/signup feature that unlocks new parts of the website
* animations (menu already has some)
* add flash announcements
