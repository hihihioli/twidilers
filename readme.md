# Welcome to Twidilers
You should be one of the three of us. Otherwise, why are you here?
Github told me to add this but I don't know what to write here.
Why does this page exist?


# Bugs
## User accounts
* Login/signup pages can be accessed while logged in
* user accounts can be created with the same username as a deleted account


# New feature wishlist
## Profile page
* other users profile pages
* settings page is seperate from user page
* users' posts on their profile page
* ability to change password

## Settings page
* Different submenus for things such as the following:
    * Public Information (change username, display name, profile picture)
        * Changing username should require a password challenge
    * Security (delete account, change password, etc)
    * Privacy (is the profile page private, are your posts anon or linked to your account)
    * 


## Posts
* Reactions (reply, like/dislike) on posts
* Blog posts (posts you can click on, segregated from main feed)
* profile pictures next to name of poster
* removal of titles (except for blog posts)
