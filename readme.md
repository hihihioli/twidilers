# Welcome to Twidilers
You should be one of the three of us. Otherwise, why are you here?
Github told me to add this but I don't know what to write here.
Why does this page exist?

## What do we need to add?
I added some dependencies to the navbar--we need to add login.html, newuser.html, about.html, and a header logo. Of course, we don't have to do this but I tried to get the ball rolling.
