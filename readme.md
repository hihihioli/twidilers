# Welcome to Twidilers
You should be one of the three of us. Otherwise, why are you here?
Github told me to add this but I don't know what to write here.
Why does this page exist?


# Bugs
## User accounts
* user accounts can be created with the same username as a deleted account
* You can't delete your account
* user account names are case sensative

        * option to force poeple to request to follow you

## Feed
* Reactions (reply, like/dislike) on posts
* Blog posts (posts you can click on, segregated from main feed)
    * Blog posts would accept raw HTML
* removal of titles (except for blog posts)
* Algorithmic feed that prefers newer posts by people you follow/interact with
    * Newness weight would be this: y=-0.2x^{4}+1 where x=time and y=weight (to be tweaked)
    * Weight for the poster (Have you interacted with their posts recently (negetively or positively), do you follow them)
