### 12/2/24
I added some dependencies to the navbar--we need to add login.html, newuser.html, about.html, and a header logo. Of course, we don't have to do this but I tried to get the ball rolling.

Made the html files and logo stuff. Tomorrow going to make the models and schema for the database when Oliver creates it on the server.

### 12/3/24
Added animations and dark mode. Added more page content

I am going to start making the design of the sign up page and setting up the forms. Might need Eamon's help with the graphical design and we also need to figure out the .env thing to use session data and sqlalchemy

-Derin

Eamon did the styling so I will start working in the database config
