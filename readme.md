# Welcome to Twidilers
You should be one of the three of us. Otherwise, why are you here?
Github told me to add this but I don't know what to write here.
Why does this page exist?

## What have we done?
### 12/2/24
I added some dependencies to the navbar--we need to add login.html, newuser.html, about.html, and a header logo. Of course, we don't have to do this but I tried to get the ball rolling.

-Eamon


Made the html files and logo stuff. Tomorrow going to make the models and schema for the database when Oliver creates it on the server.

-Derin

### 12/3/24
Added animations and dark mode. Added more page content

I am going to start making the design of the sign up page and setting up the forms. Might need Eamon's help with the graphical design and we also need to figure out the .env thing to use session data and sqlalchemy

-Derin

Eamon did the styling so I will start working in the database config

-Derin

### 12/4/24
Add stuff to do when logged in

### 12/6/24
I am working on hashing and adding a profile photo system

-Oliver

## What should we work on?
* add some more pages and page content
* push the old websites maybe
* work on sign in interface (specifically lightmode)
* do the facebook blog feed thing (kinda done)
* profile photo system(oliver)
